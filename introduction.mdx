## What is Gurubase?

Gurubase transforms your existing content into intelligent, topic-specific AI assistants called "Gurus." These AI-powered assistants can answer questions, provide support, and guide users through your documentation, code, and knowledge base.

### Supported Data Sources

Create comprehensive knowledge bases from multiple content types:

- Websites (sitemap import or crawling)
- PDF documents and manuals
- Custom text snippets
- Excel files and spreadsheets
- GitHub repositories and codebases
- Confluence documents
- Technical documentation
- Zendesk tickets and articles
- Jira issues and project data
- YouTube videos and tutorials

### How It Works

Start by creating a Guru with your content sources, then deploy it across multiple channels. Ask questions directly through the [Gurubase platform](https://gurubase.io/gurus/), or integrate your Guru into your existing workflows with our [website widget](/integrations/website-widget), chatbots, and API.

<Note>
  **Enterprise Integration**: Gurubase offers seamless Zendesk integration through our dedicated application. Contact our team at [contact@gurubase.io](mailto:contact@gurubase.io) for enterprise setup and access.
