## Introduction

Integrate Gurubase with GitHub to ask your Guru directly within your repositories.

<Note>
For self-hosted version, you first need to setup a GitHub App manually. Please refer to the [GitHub App Setup for Self-hosted version](#github-app-setup-for-self-hosted-version) section for more details.
</Note>

## Steps to Integrate

1. **Navigate to Integrations**
   - Go to the Gurubase dashboard.
   - Click on "My Gurus" under the profile
   - Click on the Guru you want to integrate with Slack

2. **Select Slack Bot**
   - Click on the "GitHub Bot" option.

</Frame>

3. **Connect to GitHub**
   - Click the "Connect" button.
   - Authorize Gurubase to access your GitHub repositories. You can allow Gurubase to connect to all of your repositories, or you can select which ones to do so.

4. **Set Repository Mode**

- Next to each repository, there is a dropdown that allows "Auto" or "Manual" modes. 
    - "Auto" mode replies to issues when they are created
    - "Manual" mode always requires mentioning the bot for answers

Independent of this setting, you can always tag `@gurubase` to ask a question in your GitHub issues.

5. **Manage Repository Permissions**

- At the end of the page, next to the "Save" button, there is a "Manage" button. It takes you to the GitHub app installation settings for you to add/remove repositories for the app. After an update, you can refresh the GitHub integration page on Gurubase to see the final version.

## Permissions

Gurubase will request the following permissions:
- View repository metadata.
- Read and write discussions, issues, and pull requests.

<Note>
The discussions and pull requests are not supported yet. The GitHub bot can only be used in issues.
</Note>

## Using the Bot

Once integrated, you can mention the bot using `@gurubase` in your GitHub issues to ask questions directly to your Guru. The bot also considers the issue comments for generating answers.
<Note>
For self-hosted version, you need to mention the bot using `@<app_slug_you_gave_to_the_bot>` instead of `@gurubase`. You can find this slug in the URL when you navigate to the app settings.
</Note>

## GitHub App Setup for Self-hosted version
For self-hosted version, you need to create your own GitHub app to create a bot to integrate with your Gurubase Self-hosted instance. Below are the steps to create the app and get the bot token.

1. GitHub will send events to  `/api/github/` endpoint of your Gurubase instance. If the Gurubase instance URL is not public, you need to open it to public. You can use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to do this:
   - If you haven't changed, the default port of Gurubase instance is 8029. You need to use this to make it publicly accessible.
   - Make Gurubase instance URL public with `ngrok http http://localhost:8029`
   - Copy the public URL from the ngrok terminal as shown below:

2. Go to https://github.com/settings/apps and click "New GitHub App".
3. Type in the name, description, and homepage URL. You can specify `https://gurubase.io/` for the Homepage URL.
4. Leave the "Callback URL" empty and untick all of the checkboxes below it.

5. Under "Post installation", keep the "Setup URL" empty and untick "Redirect on update".

</Frame>

6. Under "Webhook", make it active.

7. Set the Webhook URL as `<ngrok_url>/api/github/`

<Note>
Make sure you keep the `/` at the end.
</Note>

8. Optionally, you can set a secret.

9. Keep SSL verification enabled.

10. Under "Permissions", click "Repository permissions"

11. Select "Read and write" for these:

- Discussions (disabled on bot for now)
- Issues
- Pull requests (disabled on bot for now)

<Note>
This will also add Read-only permission to Metadata. Keep it.
</Note>

12. Under "Subscribe to events", tick these:

- Discussion
- Discussion comment
- Issues
- Issue comment
- Pull request
- Pull request review
- Pull request review comment
- Pull request review thread

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/github-bot/github-events.png" alt="GitHub Events" />
</Frame>

13. In the final section "Where can this GitHub App be installed?
", keep "Only on this account".

14. Then, create the app. This will take you to the app settings page.

15. Get the "Client ID" from this page.

16. Scroll down to the "Private keys". Click "Generate a private key". This will download the generated private key.

17. Scroll top. On the left menu, click "Install App".

18. Go through the instructions.

19. Once done, it will take you to a page with URL `https://github.com/settings/installations/<installation_id>`. Get the installation ID from here.

<Note>
This connects the app to your repositories, but you still need to connect the app to your guru.
</Note>

20. Now, open Gurubase and go to the GitHub integration page. 

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/github-bot/gurubase-github-empty.png" alt="Gurubase Github Empty" />
</Frame>

21. Paste the client ID, installation ID, and the private key to the sections. If you have configured a webhook secret, provide it as well. Then click "Connect".

<Note>
If you do not provide a webhook secret, it will not be checked even if it is configured on GitHub.
</Note>

22. And that is done. You can now start to use the app.
