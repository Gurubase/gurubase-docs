## Using the Integration

After integrating with Zendesk, you can add Zendesk tickets and articles as data sources to your Guru in two ways:

### Option 1: Add Individual Tickets/Articles

Choose this option when you want to add specific Zendesk tickets or articles by entering their URLs. This is best for targeted content where you know exactly which items you want to include.

When adding individual items, you can:
- **Set Date Range**: Define start and end dates to filter content by creation date
- **Add Multiple Items**: Enter Zendesk ticket or article URLs, with each item on a new line
- **Choose Content Type**: Select between "Fetch Tickets" or "Fetch Articles" based on what you want to import

### Option 2: Create Backfill Job

Choose this option to automatically import multiple tickets or help center articles based on your criteria. This is best for bulk imports and ongoing synchronization. You can also manually trigger the indexing process by clicking on the "Sync Now" option.

When creating a backfill job, you can configure:
- **Sync Interval**: How often to check for new content (minimum 1 hour)
- **Content Type**: Choose between Zendesk tickets or help center articles
- **Automatic Updates**: The job will periodically sync new content that matches your criteria

<Note>
Zendesk integration supports both support tickets and knowledge base articles:
- **Tickets**: Import customer support conversations, including comments and attachments
- **Articles**: Import help center articles and documentation from your knowledge base
