4. **Select Channels**
   - Choose the channels you want to integrate with Gurubase.
   - Click "Save".

## Permissions

Gurubase will request the following permissions:
- View content and info about channels & conversations.
- Perform actions in channels & conversations and send messages as Gurubase bot.

## Using the Bot

Once integrated, you can mention the bot using `@Gurubase.io` in your Slack channels to ask questions directly to your Guru.
<Note>
For self-hosted version, you need to mention the bot using `@<app_name_you_gave_to_the_bot>` instead of `@Gurubase.io`.
</Note>

## Slack App Setup for Self-hosted version
For self-hosted version, you need to create your own Slack app to create a bot to integrate with your Gurubase Self-hosted instance. Below are the steps to create the app and get the bot token.

1. Go to https://api.slack.com/apps and click "Create New App".
2. Select "From scratch", give it a name and pick your workspace.
3. Slack will send events to your backend. If your backend is not public, you need to open it to public. You can use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to do this, for example: `ngrok http <your_backend_url>`.
4. Go to "Event Subscriptions" page on your Slack app and enable it.
5. Set your public url along with the path `/slack/events` as "Request Url", this is the url that Slack will send the events to.
    - `${your_public_backend_url}/slack/events`
6. Expand the "Subscribe to bot events" section on "Event Subscriptions" page and add the following events:
    - `message.channels`
    - `message.groups`

    - `channels:join`
    - `channels:read`
    - `chat:write`
    - `groups:read`
    - `channels:history`
    - `groups:history`

10. Go through the OAuth flow.
11. After installation, you will be redirected to the same page.
12. Copy "Bot User OAuth Token".
13. Go to your guru's Slack integration page in the Gurubase UI and paste the bot token you copied and click "Connect".
