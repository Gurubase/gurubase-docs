## Overview

Multi-Answer Jobs allow you to upload an Excel file containing multiple questions and automatically generate AI answers for them. Perfect for bulk question processing, testing answer quality, and managing large-scale Q&A generation.

### What Multi-Answer Jobs Enable

Multi-Answer Jobs enable you to:
- **Process multiple questions at once** from Excel spreadsheets
- **Generate answers in multiple columns** with different instructions per column
- **Track job progress** in real-time as answers are generated
- **Export results** for further use or analysis

## Creating a Multi-Answer Job

The job creation process consists of five configuration steps, followed by validation and job creation.

#### Column-Specific Instructions (Optional)

Each answer column can have custom instructions.

#### General Instruction (Optional)

Provide general instructions that apply to all answers across all columns for consistent tone, style, or context.

#### Filter by Sources/Labels (Optional)

Configure filters to limit which data sources or labels should be used when generating answers.

### Step 7: Ignore Rows

Mark specific rows to be ignored during processing. Useful for skipping test questions, examples, or invalid entries.

**Instructions:** Click or drag on ROWS to mark them as ignored.

The job summary shows how many rows have been ignored, and these rows will be excluded from processing.

## Validation

</Frame>

Before creating the job, Gurubase automatically validates your configuration. You can also manually trigger it by clicking "Validate". The validation shows:

- **Total Questions:** Number of questions that will be processed (excluding ignored rows)
- **Answers to Generate:** Total number of answers (questions × answer columns)
- **Answers to Skip:** If answer columns are filled for some rows, they will be skipped. 
- **Answer Column Breakdown:** Shows how many answers will be generated per column

Green progress bars indicate all planned answers are ready. Once validation is successful, click "Create Job" to start processing.
