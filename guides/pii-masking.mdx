## PII Masking

PII (Personally Identifiable Information) masking automatically redacts sensitive data from your content to protect privacy and comply with data protection regulations.

### How PII Masking Works

PII masking operates across three key areas:
- **Questions asked**: User queries are scanned and sensitive data is masked before processing
- **File attachments**: Documents uploaded during question asking are processed for PII removal
- **Data source indexing**: All data sources are masked during the indexing process

When a regex pattern matches content, it's replaced with `<<label>>` format (e.g., `<<EMAIL>>`, `<<SSN>>`).

### Configuration

Configure PII masks using regex patterns:
- **Case sensitive**: All pattern matching is case-sensitive
- **PCRE 2 standard**: Follows Perl Compatible Regular Expressions 2 specification
- **Validation**: Test your regex patterns at [regex101.com](https://regex101.com/) before implementation

### Example Results

The masking process automatically identifies and replaces sensitive information while preserving the overall context and readability of your content.
