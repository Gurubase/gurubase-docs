## Example Questions

Example questions are pre-configured prompts that appear on your Guru's main page and widget interface. They help guide users on what they can ask your Guru, improving user onboarding and engagement.

### Why Use Example Questions?

- **Improve user onboarding**: Help first-time users understand what your Guru can do
- **Highlight key capabilities**: Showcase the types of questions your Guru can answer
- **Reduce friction**: Users can click directly on an example to start a conversation
- **Demonstrate use cases**: Show common scenarios where your Guru provides value

## Configuration

### Where to Configure

Navigate to your Guru's settings page and scroll down to the **Advanced Settings** section. You'll find the **Example Questions** section alongside other settings like PII Masking Rules and Source Ordering.

## Best Practices

### Writing Effective Example Questions

<Tip>
Write questions that represent common use cases and demonstrate your Guru's expertise.
</Tip>

**Good examples:**
- "How do I integrate the widget into my website?"
- "What are the pricing plans available?"
- "How do I reset my password?"

**Keep in mind:**
- Use clear, natural language
- Focus on frequently asked questions
- Cover different aspects of your Guru's knowledge
- Keep questions concise (under 100 characters)

### Strategic Use Cases

1. **Product documentation**: "How do I get started with [product]?"
2. **Technical support**: "How do I troubleshoot [common issue]?"
3. **Sales enablement**: "What features are included in the Pro plan?"
4. **Onboarding**: "What can this Guru help me with?"

## Important Notes

<Warning>
Example questions are text-only suggestions. They are not linked to existing answered questions in the database, they serve purely as prompts to guide users.
</Warning>

- Example questions help set user expectations about your Guru's capabilities
- Consider updating them periodically based on analytics and user feedback
- Use the [Analytics](/guides/analytics) feature to identify popular topics and optimize your example questions
