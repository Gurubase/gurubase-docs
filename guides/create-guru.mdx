## What is a Guru?

A Guru is an intelligent AI assistant that answers questions about specific topics based on the knowledge sources you provide. Transform your existing content into a powerful Q&A system that can support users, provide documentation assistance, and serve as an expert knowledge base.

### Supported Data Sources

Create comprehensive knowledge bases from multiple content types:

- Websites (sitemap import or crawling)
- PDF documents and manuals
- Custom text snippets
- Excel files and spreadsheets
- GitHub repositories and codebases
- Confluence documents
- Technical documentation
- Zendesk tickets and articles
- Jira issues and project data
- YouTube videos and tutorials

### Deployment Options

After creating your Guru, deploy it across multiple channels:
- **Gurubase Platform**: Direct access through the web interface
- **[Website Widget](/integrations/website-widget)**: Embed directly into your website
- **[Slack Integration](/integrations/slack-bot)**: Add as a Slack bot for team support
- **[Discord Integration](/integrations/discord-bot)**: Deploy as a Discord bot for community support
- **[GitHub Integration](/integrations/github-bot)**: Integrate with repositories for code assistance
- **[API Access](/api-reference/introduction)**: Programmatic integration with your applications

## Creating a New Guru

The creation process differs depending on your Gurubase deployment:

### Gurubase.io (Hosted Platform)

If you're using [Gurubase.io](https://gurubase.io/), request a new Guru from our team by completing [this form](https://gurubase.io/guru/create). Our team will set up your Guru and provide access credentials.

### Self-Hosted Installation (Enterprise Only)

<Note>
Self-hosted installations are exclusively available under the Enterprise plan. To request access to the self-hosted package, please contact us at **contact@gurubase.io**.
</Note>

For enterprise self-hosted deployments, follow these steps to create your Guru:

- **Guru Logo**: Upload a logo image (PNG or JPEG format, maximum 1MB)
- **Topics**: Add comma-separated topics that define your Guru's expertise (e.g., "programming, microservices, containers"). This contextual information helps the AI provide more accurate, relevant responses

#### 3. Add Knowledge Sources

Build your Guru's knowledge base by adding relevant content sources:
- **Websites**: Add website URLs to index and answer questions about your website content. You can use sitemap import or crawl website to add multiple pages at once.
- **PDF Documents**: Upload PDF files to index and answer questions about your documentation.
- **GitHub Repositories**: Link your GitHub repositories to enable code-aware assistance and documentation.
- **Zendesk Tickets**: Link your Zendesk tickets to enable support and answer questions about your Zendesk content.
- **Jira Issues**: Link your Jira issues to enable support and answer questions about your Jira content.
- **YouTube Videos**: Add YouTube video URLs to index and answer questions about your YouTube content. You can use channel import or playlist import to add multiple videos at once.
- **Confluence Documents**: Add Confluence document URLs to index and answer questions about your Confluence content.
- **Excel Files**: Upload Excel files to index and answer questions about your spreadsheet data.
- **Custom Text Snippets**: Add custom text snippets to index and answer questions about your custom content



#### 4. Publish Your Guru

Click "Publish Guru" to initiate the creation process. The system will:
1. Index all provided sources
2. Process and embed the content
3. Make your Guru available for questions

Processing time varies based on the volume and complexity of your sources.
