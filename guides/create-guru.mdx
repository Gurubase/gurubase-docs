## What is a Guru?

A Guru is an AI-powered Q&A assistant that can answer questions about any topic based on the sources you provide. Each Guru can process multiple types of content:
- ðŸ“„ Websites
- ðŸ“‘ PDF documents
- ðŸŽ¥ YouTube videos
- ðŸ’» GitHub repositories


<Note type="warning">
  Currently, only the Gurubase team can create new Gurus on [Gurubase.io](https://gurubase.io/). You'll need to request [Guru creation](#request-a-new-guru-gurubase-io) and [claim it](#claim-your-guru-gurubase-io) for management. 
  
  For self-hosted users, you can [create your own Gurus](#creating-a-new-guru-self-hosted).
</Note>

## Request a New Guru (Gurubase.io)

   - If not a maintainer, proof of maintainer's permission

Fill in the following information:
- **Guru Name**: Choose a descriptive name for your Guru
- **Guru Logo**: Upload a logo (PNG or JPEG under 1MB)
- **Topics**: Add comma-separated topics related to this Guru, e.g., "programming, microservices, containers". This helps the AI understand the Guru's expertise and context.
