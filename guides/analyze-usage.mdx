The usage analytics dashboard provides a detailed overview of your Guru's usage. The time filter at the top affects the data in all sections. 

Below are the sections that you can find in the usage analytics dashboard:

### 1. Questions Section

The questions section shows the questions that have been asked to your Guru over time. You can filter the questions by the source type including Slack, Discord, GitHub, Website Widget, API, and Gurubase UI. You can sort the questions by the date and do search by the question text.

<Note>
  You can see duplicates in the questions. This is because the same question can be asked multiple times over time.
</Note>

### 2. Unable to Answer Section

The unable to answer section shows the questions that your Guru was unable to answer. The reason could be that the question is unrelated to the Guru, or the Guru's data source is insufficient to generate a reliable answer. 

This provides valuable insight into whether your data sources are sufficient for your users. You can improve your data sources and reindex them to enable your Guru to answer more questions.

### 3. Referenced Data Sources Section

The referenced data sources section shows the data sources that your Guru has used to answer the questions. You can filter the data sources by the source type including Website, PDF, YouTube, and Codebase. The "Referenced" column shows the number of times the data source has been referenced to answer the questions. Once you click on it, you can see the answers that have been generated by using the data source.
