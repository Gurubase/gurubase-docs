title: 'Start Website Crawl'
api: 'POST /{guru_slug}/crawl/start/'
description: 'Initiate a crawl to explore the URLs of a website'
---

Starts an **asynchronous** website crawl operation to find all the sub URLs of the provided root URL. 

You can check the status of created crawl operation using the [Get Crawl Status](/api-reference/endpoints/crawler-status) endpoint or stop it using the [Stop Crawl](/api-reference/endpoints/crawler-stop) endpoint.

Crawling does not mean that the discovered URLs are indexed immediately. You need to manually add the discovered URLs as a data source by passing them to [Create Data Source](/api-reference/endpoints/create-datasources) endpoint.

<Note>
Crawls are rate limited to 1 concurrent operation per Guru type. Subsequent requests will fail if a crawl is already running.
