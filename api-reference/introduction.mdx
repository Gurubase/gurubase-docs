Welcome to the Gurubase API reference documentation. Our API enables you to programmatically manage AI-powered Q&A assistants ("Gurus").

<Note>
  Gurus can only be created through the Gurubase platform interface. The API is used for managing and interacting with existing Gurus.
</Note>

## Base URL

```bash
https://api.gurubase.io/api/v1/<guru_slug>
```

<Note type="warning">
If you're using a self-hosted Gurubase (available exclusively under the Enterprise plan), you must call its backend API URL. The default backend URL for a self-hosted Gurubase API is `http://localhost:8029/api/v1/<guru_slug>`. To request access to the self-hosted package, contact us at contact@gurubase.io.
</Note>

The `guru_slug` is a unique identifier for your Guru that can be found in the URL when accessing your Guru through the Gurubase platform interface. For example, if your Guru is accessible at https://gurubase.io/g/anteon, then the `guru_slug` is `anteon`.

<Note type="warning">
Youtube channel/playlist API endpoints do not require `guru_slug`.
</Note>
